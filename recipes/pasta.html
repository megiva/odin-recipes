        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Vodka pasta, also known as penne alla vodka, is a popular Italian-American dish that features a rich and creamy tomato sauce infused with a splash of vodka. The alcohol enhances the flavors of the tomatoes and balances the creaminess of the sauce, making for a deliciously smooth pasta dish.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces penne pasta (or any pasta of your choice)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vodka</li>
            <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook Pasta: </strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li><strong>Saut√© Aromatics: </strong>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Vodka: </strong>Pour in the vodka, stirring to combine. Cook for 2-3 minutes to let the alcohol evaporate.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Tomatoes: </strong>Stir in the crushed tomatoes and simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Cream: </strong>Reduce the heat to low, then stir in the heavy cream. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sauce is well combined and heated through.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine with Pasta: </strong>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing to coat evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, gradually add reserved pasta water until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li><strong>Season and Serve: </strong>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil if desired.</li>
        </ol>
